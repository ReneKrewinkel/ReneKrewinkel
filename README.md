# Hi there, I'm René Krewinkel 

_I am a very experienced (30+ years) digital bohemian. 
I'm currently working as an all round developer, front-end architect, 
graphic/ux/ui designer, consultant and teacher in software development._

Creativity defines me as a person—both professionally and
privately, ‘_creating_’ is the common thread in my life.  
As I keep trying to stretch the limits of my own knowledge,
my understanding of, among other things,
technical issues become increasingly unambiguous, and I
often _see_ the solutions in layered and defined structures. This, 
combined with in-depth and broad technical knowledge, allows me to not only
envision solutions but also design and realise them.
