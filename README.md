# Hi there, I'm René Krewinkel 

_I am a very experienced (30+ years) digital bohemian. 
I'm currently working as an all round developer, front-end architect, 
graphic/ux/ui designer, consultant and teacher in software development._

Creativity defines me as a person—both professionally and
privately, ‘_creating_’ is the common thread in my life.  
As I keep trying to stretch the limits of my own knowledge,
my understanding of, among other things,
technical issues become increasingly unambiguous, and I
often _see_ the solutions in layered and defined structures. This, 
combined with in-depth and broad technical knowledge, allows me to not only
envision solutions but also design and realise them.

[re:cognition](https://re-cognition.app): A personal project I'm currently working on to help people who suffer from (cognitive) disabilities. Please check out the website for details.



<img src='https://github.com/room-id/.github/raw/main/profile/images/room-id-logo-spacing.svg' alt='room・id' style="height: 160px"/>

[room・id](https://room-id.nl): Investigators are often left with only fragments of images—anonymous hotel rooms that all look the same. These spaces become silent backdrops of exploitation, nearly impossible to identify without the right tools. Every room has a story. We help reveal where it was told.
